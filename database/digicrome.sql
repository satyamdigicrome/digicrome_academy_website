While traditional statistics focuses on inference and hypothesis testing, data science incorporates machine learning, programming, and domain expertise to derive actionable insights from data.</p><h3>2. Define supervised and unsupervised learning with examples<br>&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong></p><p>In supervised learning, the model learns from labelled data, where input data is paired with corresponding output labels. It aims to predict or classify new data based on past examples.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>Predicting house prices based on features like square footage, bedrooms, and location.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong></p><p>In unsupervised learning, the model learns from unlabeled data, seeking to find patterns or structures within the data without explicit guidance.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Clustering similar documents based on their content without predefined categories.</p><h3>3. Explain the difference between classification and regression</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Classification is a type of supervised learning task where the goal is to categorize data into predefined classes or labels. Regression, on the other hand, aims to predict a continuous numerical value based on input features. For example, predicting whether an email is spam (classification) versus predicting house prices (regression).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>4. What is overfitting in machine learning, and how can it be prevented?</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Overfitting occurs when a model learns to capture noise and fluctuations in the training data, resulting in poor generalization to unseen data. It can be prevented by techniques such as cross-validation, regularization, and using simpler models.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>5. Describe the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning.</h3><p><strong>Answer: </strong>The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the balance between a model\'s ability to capture the underlying patterns in the data (bias) and its sensitivity to noise and fluctuations (variance). A high-bias model tends to underfit the data, while a high-variance model tends to overfit. Achieving an optimal tradeoff involves selecting a model complexity that minimizes both bias and variance.</p><h3>6. What are the steps involved in the data science lifecycle?</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The data science lifecycle typically involves several stages: problem definition, data collection, data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection and training, model evaluation, and deployment. Additionally, the lifecycle may include iterative processes for refining models and incorporating feedback.</p><h3>7. Define feature engineering and its importance in machine learning.</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, and creating new features from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning models. It involves identifying informative features, handling missing data, scaling numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and creating new features based on domain knowledge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>8.&nbsp;What is the significance of exploratory data analysis (EDA)?</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Exploratory data analysis involves visually and statistically exploring datasets to understand their underlying patterns, distributions, relationships, and anomalies. It helps identify data quality issues, inform feature selection and engineering, uncover insights, and generate hypotheses for further analysis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>9.&nbsp;Explain the difference between correlation and causation.</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, while causation indicates a direct cause-and-effect relationship between them. Correlation does not imply causation, as two variables may be correlated due to a common underlying factor or coincidence. Establishing causation requires controlled experiments or rigorous causal inference methods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>10.&nbsp;What is the central limit theorem, and why is it important in statistics?</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The central limit theorem states that the distribution of sample means of a population approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution. It is important because it allows statisticians to make inferences about population parameters based on sample statistics, even when the population distribution is unknown or non-normal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Statistical Concepts:</strong></h2><h3>11. Define probability distributions and provide examples.</h3><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Probability distributions describe the likelihood of different outcomes in a random process. Examples include the normal distribution (bell curve), binomial distribution (coin flips), Poisson distribution (rare events), exponential distribution (time between events), and uniform distribution (equal probability over a range).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>12.&nbsp;What is hypothesis testing, and how is it used in data science?</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Hypothesis testing is a statistical method for making inferences about population parameters based on sample data. It involves formulating null and alternative hypotheses, selecting a significance level (alpha), calculating test statistics, and making decisions about whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on the test result.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.&nbsp;Explain the concept of p-value and its significance in hypothesis testing.</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. It measures the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to its rejection if below the chosen significance level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>14.&nbsp;What are Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing?</h3><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected when it is actually true (false positive), while Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly not rejected when it is actually false (false negative). The significance level (alpha) of a hypothesis test determines the probability of Type I error, while the power of the test relates to the probability of avoiding Type II error.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>15.&nbsp;Define confidence intervals and their interpretation.</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A confidence interval is a range of values calculated from sample data that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a specified level of confidence. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean indicates that if the sampling process were repeated many times, 95% of the resulting intervals would contain the true population mean.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>16.&nbsp;Explain the concept of A/B testing and its applications.</h3><p><strong>Answer: </strong>A/B testing is a controlled experiment method used to compare two versions (A and B) of a webpage, product, or feature to determine which one performs better in terms of predefined metrics such as conversion rate, click-through rate, or revenue. It involves randomly assigning users to different versions, collecting data on their behaviour, and analyzing the results to make data-driven decisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>17.&nbsp;What is the difference between parametric and non-parametric statistics?</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Parametric statistics make assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data, such as normality and homogeneity of variance, and use parameters to describe population characteristics. Non-parametric statistics, on the other hand, do not make strict assumptions about the population distribution and rely on fewer assumptions or rank-based methods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>18.&nbsp;Define statistical power and its importance in experimental design.</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (i.e., avoiding a Type II error). It is influenced by factors such as sample size, effect size, and significance level. A higher statistical power indicates a greater ability to detect true effects, making it crucial for experimental design to ensure that studies have adequate power to detect meaningful differences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>19.&nbsp;Explain the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics.</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Descriptive statistics summarizes and describes the main features of a dataset, providing insights into characteristics like central tendency and variability. Inferential statistics, on the other hand, uses sample data to make predictions or inferences about a larger population, relying on probability theory and statistical methods to conclude. Descriptive statistics focuses on analyzing observed data, while inferential statistics aims to make predictions or generalizations about populations based on sample data.</p><h3>20.&nbsp;What is sampling and its importance in statistical analysis?</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Sampling involves selecting a subset of individuals or data points from a larger population to make inferences or estimates about the entire population. It is crucial in statistical analysis as it allows researchers to gather data efficiently, reduce costs, and make predictions or generalizations about populations without needing to examine every individual or data point.
